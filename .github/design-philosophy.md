1. UI UX as Applied Epistemology

What the user is allowed to know, when, and with what confidence.

Good Example

A billing dashboard shows:

Current plan

Next charge date

Exact amount

Clear path to change or cancel

Nothing is hidden behind secondary clicks. The system teaches the user what is true about their financial relationship at a glance.

Why it works
The interface aligns perceived reality with actual system state. No guessing. No interpretive labor.

Bad Example

Same dashboard shows:

Plan name only

“Billing details” link

Charges explained in a tooltip

Nothing is false. Everything is technically available. But the truth is obscured.

Why it fails
The system withholds clarity. The user cannot confidently answer “What will happen next?” without investigation.

2. Phenomenology

Meaning arises from lived interaction, not explanation.

Good Example

A design tool opens directly into a canvas with one visible action: add content. No modal. No tour. The tool teaches by use.

Why it works
Understanding emerges through embodied action. The system respects how humans learn.

Bad Example

Same tool opens with a three-step onboarding modal explaining concepts the user has not yet encountered.

Why it fails
The system demands abstraction before experience. Users are forced to memorize before meaning exists.

3. Affordances as Moral Promises

Every visible action makes a claim about consequence.

Good Example

A destructive action uses clear language: “Delete permanently.” Confirmation repeats the consequence.

Why it works
The promise is explicit. The outcome matches the expectation. Trust is preserved.

Bad Example

The same action is labeled “Remove.” Undo is not available.

Why it fails
The affordance promises reversibility while delivering finality. This is not malicious, just careless, and still corrosive.

4. Cognitive Load as Burden

Not about intelligence. About unnecessary weight.

Good Example

A form reveals fields progressively based on prior answers. Only relevant choices appear.

Why it works
The system carries complexity on behalf of the user.

Bad Example

All fields are shown at once, even those rarely needed.

Why it fails
The user is forced to scan and self-filter. The burden is shifted outward.

5. Information Architecture as Ontology

The system defines what exists and how it relates.

Good Example

A CMS distinguishes clearly between Page, Template, and Content Block, each with distinct purpose and behavior.

Why it works
The ontology matches the mental model of creation and reuse.

Bad Example

Everything is called “Item,” differentiated only by subtle icons.

Why it fails
The system refuses to name reality. Users must memorize exceptions instead of understanding structure.

6. Time as the Hidden Axis

UX is experienced across moments, not screens.

Good Example

A long-running process shows progress, explains delays, and estimates completion.

Why it works
Time is acknowledged. Waiting is contextualized.

Bad Example

Same process shows a spinner with no explanation.

Why it fails
The user is suspended in uncertainty. The system feels indifferent to their time.

7. Power and Stewardship

Interfaces govern behavior whether acknowledged or not.

Good Example

Default settings favor user privacy, with advanced options available but not forced.

Why it works
Power is exercised conservatively. The system assumes responsibility.

Bad Example

Defaults favor data sharing. Opt-out is possible but buried.

Why it fails
The system exploits asymmetry quietly. Not illegal. Still unethical.

8. Beauty as Evidence of Order

Aesthetic coherence signals internal coherence.

Good Example

Consistent spacing, typography, and interaction patterns across the product.

Why it works
The visual order reflects systemic order. Users trust what they see.

Bad Example

Multiple spacing systems, inconsistent button styles, minor visual drift.

Why it fails
The system feels patched together. Users subconsciously expect deeper inconsistencies.

9. Failure States Reveal Belief

Errors expose what you think of users.

Good Example

An error says what happened, why, and how to recover.

Why it works
The system assumes good intent and offers partnership.

Bad Example

An error says “Invalid input.”

Why it fails
The system withholds explanation. The user is blamed by omission.

10. Telos

Why this system exists at all.

Good Example

A task app helps users complete tasks and then get out of the way. No artificial friction to keep them engaged.

Why it works
The system serves completion, not addiction.

Bad Example

Same app adds unnecessary streaks and nags unrelated to task value.

Why it fails
The system confuses engagement with purpose.

A System in Harmony

All principles aligned.

A simple invoicing app:

Clear billing truth

Immediate action on first use

Honest affordances

Minimal forms

Clean conceptual model

Transparent waiting

Respectful defaults

Visual coherence

Humane errors

Goal is sending invoices, not staying logged in

Result
Users feel calm. Competent. Unoppressed. The system disappears into purpose.

A System in Disharmony

Nothing catastrophic. Everything slightly off.

Same app:

Billing details slightly hidden

Onboarding before action

Ambiguous button labels

Overloaded forms

Vague content categories

Spinners without explanation

Aggressive defaults

Minor visual inconsistency

Generic errors

Engagement metrics prioritized

Result
Users feel vaguely tired. Distrust grows. Support tickets rise. Churn is blamed on users.

Final Compression

Good UX is not clever.
Bad UX is not usually malicious.

The difference is whether the system tells the truth about itself and carries weight the user should not have to carry.

If you want, next we can:

Apply this lens to a real product you use daily

Translate this into a design review checklist that is philosophical, not procedural

Map this directly to theological categories like sin, stewardship, and telos

Say the word.
